In this module challenge, I was tasked with created a personal portfolio page. 

On the page, you'll find information about who I am, and what I hope to accomplish. 

There is a functioning navigation bar to conveniently take you to the corresponding section.

In the section showcasing my work, there is a link to my very first assignment. This section will see many updates in the coming weeks, adding new projects as I complete them. 

Here is a link to this portfolio for your viewing:

Also, there is a screenshot attached to the repository, giving a glimpse of the webpage.
